A few years ago, my mother who is very religious to the point of being a fanatic said something crazy that inspired me to question whether Christianity (or the story of Jesus and all that) was real. I did some research which led me to Judaism and then started studying that as well only to find that both are just myth and a grand waste of my time and money. I don't believe in psychics or the supernatural at all, but in my life there was a cool coincidence that more former roommate contacted me to tell me she dreamt I was pregnant and later on I did get pregnant.

R_ym5kausC126EloZ,"Spiritual but not religious,Agnostic","I was raised strict pentecostal growing up- my Dad was a pentecostal minister. I saw many sinister sides to leaders in the church and how they covered up for each other. I grew up too scared of hell to go against my parents. I was saving myself for marriage and lost it to rape when I was 22 by a religious leader in the church I was dating. I told him no plainly and he stole my virginity anyway. I went numb and left the church and never reported it. I regret not reporting it but at the time I was so brainwashed by religion and didn't want to believe it happened even though back in my mind it did. Religion fucked me up and I refuse to raise my own kids in religion. Luckily my husband and I have the same belief on religion. We raise our kids by 2 principles- be kind but stand up for yourself and others and do the right thing. While we know that it's impossible to always do the right thing, we can at lease make an attempt at it. No one is perfect. My Dad has a NPD and being raised by a narcissist minister has a profound effect on who I am. Most (I'm not going to say all) religious leaders have a thirst for control and power. I mean... Whats the more power than having the power over peoples souls and telling them how they should live?- and then guilting them and offering them personal counseling when the religious leader has no professional counseling training?

I will give you just one example of this.  One day I was debating whether or not to purchase a package of monthly stickers for my planner.   These were very generic stickers and had nothing to do with Maharaji or Ram Dass, so in an effort to talk myself out of spending the money for them, I told myself that if they have a ""Be Here Now"" sticker (a phrase connected to both Maharaji and Ram Dass), I would purchase them.  Lo and behold, when I got to the stickers for October, there was a ""Be Here Now"" sticker.  I started laughing and purchased them.   Then I turned on YouTube and the very first sugested video that came up for me on YouTube was an MSNBC video with Ari Melber.  At the end of the news video, Ari Melber said to his guest (I don't remember who that was) ""or Be Here Now as Ram Dass would say.""   Needless to say I practically fell out of my wheelchair at that point as I could imagine Maharaji with a big ""gotcha grin"" on his face.  I have heard many similar stories from others who also follow Maharaji's teachings.    Also, things like my monthly donation to Feeding America are because of Maharaji who taught ""feed people, serve people.""",Never,Very important,Several times a day,More than one religion/spirituality,More than one religion/spirituality
