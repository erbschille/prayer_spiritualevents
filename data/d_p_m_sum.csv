I'm not super open about my faith in person as my parents are still very die hard atheists with strong opinions about all religions and especially Pagan/New Age religions, and my husband was raised Catholic and had his own very negative experiences with that religion and with going to religious school.

R_210YqvysEDWRIGq,0.4705882352941176,Woman,"Jewish,Something else (Please describe below.)","Even though Maharaji left his body decades ago, many of us still feel a strong connection to him.  I will give you just one example of this.  One day I was debating whether or not to purchase a package of monthly stickers for my planner.   These were very generic stickers and had nothing to do with Maharaji or Ram Dass, so in an effort to talk myself out of spending the money for them, I told myself that if they have a ""Be Here Now"" sticker (a phrase connected to both Maharaji and Ram Dass), I would purchase them.  Lo and behold, when I got to the stickers for October, there was a ""Be Here Now"" sticker.  I started laughing and purchased them.   Then I turned on YouTube and the very first sugested video that came up for me on YouTube was an MSNBC video with Ari Melber.  At the end of the news video, Ari Melber said to his guest (I don't remember who that was) ""or Be Here Now as Ram Dass would say.""   Needless to say I practically fell out of my wheelchair at that point as I could imagine Maharaji with a big ""gotcha grin"" on his face.  I have heard many similar stories from others who also follow Maharaji's teachings.    Also, things like my monthly donation to Feeding America are because of Maharaji who taught ""feed people, serve people.""",Never,Very important,Several times a day,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I have been making notes as I worked on this survey (which is why it has taken me so long to get through it).  My notes on my background are interspersed among the other notes so I will just add them all in here since I don't know if you will give us another text box in this study:   I think a positive thought, even when not spoken out loud or expressed in a prayer, can make a difference.  If you truly wish for your friend to find a job that wish might be enough for your subconscious to get you to do that could in some way help your friend find a job - maybe drop a word to a co-worker or associate who you know knows someone in the industry that your friend is looking for a job in.  I don't think there is anything supernatural about that.  That also applies to the Sarah and Barbara example.  If Sarah cares that deeply, her subconscious might be more likely to cause her to actually act in ways that would benefit Barbara.   I didn't see any way to indicate that with the choices given though.  I don't know about winning the lottery but I absolutely believe in the power of prayer to be able to bring about cures that doctors said were impossible.  I don't know that just ""thinking good thoughts"" would help someone get better.   I believe those thoughts need to be directed into some form of prayer to be effective.  I wish this question had an ""I don't know"" option.  While I said ""never"" for the angry feelings, I think it is like the job example.   I don't believe that the feelings themselves could Jane but I do believe that if Mary is that angry at Jane, her subconscious might very well respond and cause her to be more likely to act in such a way that it would have a detrimental impact on Jane.   What is worse of all though is if Mary is very angry and has been for a long time, she is harming her own well-being.  This same thing applies to the envious feelings of Martha for Joanne.  As to ""I see shadows and shapes when there is nothing there,"" yes, occasionally but there is a well-documented medical reason for that.  I have a dementia diagnosis and as part of the dementia I sometimes have visual hallucinations.  I am quite aware that I do so when I catch a glimpse of something that doesn't make sense, I just accept it that it is my brain having a hiccup, so to speak and don't worry about it.  Some of my ""I don't know"" answers are also related to my dementia as I have a lot of memory gaps because of it so I truly don't know, for example, if I have had a premonition about the future or a dream that came true.  I don't remember doing so but that is not to say that it has not happened.  Other times my ""I don't know"" answers should be interpreted as ""I truly don't know the answer to this.""  For example, in the questions about sending a mental message to someone at a distance.   Your questions asked if I am ""completely convinced.""  I am not ""completely convinced"" one way or another but I do know that I have read of research (I think by the military) on this topic and I believe they had some degree of success beyond what one could expect from chance so it seems as if it might be possible in some situations but I really don't know.  I also have no way of knowing whether times like when I was just thinking about needing to talk to someone and they called, was that just a coincidence?  I said ""no"" to ""does anyone else share the same room (or bed) with you"" as I am guessing you meant that question to apply only to humans.  If you are including pets in that question though, then the answer should be ""yes"" as most nights one or both of our cats sleep with me.  I have actually never been to a wedding (other than my own) or a funeral in my life.  I don't go to parties or anything like that either.  I have a very plain lifestyle which I am content with.  I am vegetarian, don't drink alcoholic beverages (or even carbonated beverages) or smoke or use recreational drugs or go to movies theaters or concerts, etc.",1,More than one religion/spirituality,More than one religion/spirituality,0.43070420230895456,3.8,1.8329770166340096,Several times a day,7,All Participants

If you don't think this exists, please refer to the many CIA studies that have now become possible. My friend Jean Munzer worked as a psychic for the FBI. I am a Church Organist. There have been times I've experienced the dead during their funeral OR experienced other dead coming to greet them. I have confirmed details with the family (soldier uniforms, etc). On only 1 experience I felt a presence during the mass of a person screaming in agony asking for my help. I went to the priest afterwards who asked me to keep it in confidence that the man was a mafia hitman and as far as the priest knew that was not ever made public. I pray for that man's soul and because of him I believe Hell is not just a concept. As far as Priests; I have noticed that I have a greater faith in God than most of them I have met. Nuns on the other hand seem to all get callings and have deep faith in God. In the past 10 years, I've had a calling to start an order for women who are interested in becoming priests.

The show Evil is somewhat close to reality but there is a lot I never heard of and doubt exists (like demonic families for instance).
